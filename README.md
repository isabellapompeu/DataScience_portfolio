# Isabella Maria P. M. Padial

Student of Agronomic Engineering at the Federal University of Grande Dourados - UFGD / MS. Scholarship holder of Scientific Initiation Program - PIBIC in the field of Agricultural Entomology, developing studies in the Insect-Plant Interaction area.

After two years of laboratory work I developed myself as a very open minded person, combining work in team, observation and analytical skills. As a consequence of the development of smart agriculture I realized how Data Science skills will be fundamental in the agriculture field and so here I am. Right now I have just started to really study Data Science, with this repertoire I wish to track my progress and show my development.

All my Data Science projects.

From the very beginning.
